/**
 * Let's start thinking about the "App State". These will be the various
 * different phases of using this application. Each phase could probably
 * be considered a mini-application
 *
 * 1. Setup - This is where you set up the board, establishing the shape
 * of the board and the order the pokemon appear in
 *
 * 2. Connection - Once the board is configured, we'll try to connect to
 * another instance that we can pass that data along to. Maybe this could
 * happen in the background of other phases?
 *
 * 3. Game - This probably consists of several sub-phases, such as ship
 * placement and actual play
 *
 * 4. PostGame - After a player wins, what happens? Do we just return to
 * the main phase or give people a chance to do another round?
